# take-five

TakeFive is a web/mobile app designed to encourage users to take a minute out of their day to take in their surroundings. Upon notification, the user will be prompted to log one or more of the five senses that stands out to them at the time. Their entry will be published by their geographic location, and the user will then be able to see what other previous users have logged in that area. TakeFive promotes individuals to gain a heightened awareness of their environment -- to notice details that one may otherwise miss just going through everyday life.
